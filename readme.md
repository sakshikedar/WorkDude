  <h1 id="dummy-website">Dummy-website</h1>
<p>This is a dummy website of my planned start-up company WorkDude. This website just shows a remarkable use of CSS.
WorkDude is a creative platform which is yet to be developed. This website is just an example of the various properties used in CSS and HTML.
Feel free to add a comment on the CSS file so that people who are new to Frontend-development may get our point.</p>
